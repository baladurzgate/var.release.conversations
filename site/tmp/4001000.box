I am not so sure whether this shift from physical to mental labour should be taken that literally when it comes to software for (type)designers, and whether de-physicalisation is a useful term. Someone like Katherine Hayles writes about the embodiment, and materialization of knowledge beyond the physical in ways that seem to link to the practice of design. In Abstracting Craft: The Practiced Digital Hand, Malcolm Mccullough describes how tools shape our perspective, i.e. how physical and mental work inform each other: 

<i> Tool usage simultaneously involves direct sensation, </i> <i> provides a channel for creative will, and affirms a </i> <i> commitment to practice. The latter is quite important: </i> <i> only practice produces the most lasting and satisfying </i> <i> form of knowledge. </i> 

and later on: 

<i> A tool directs your attention. Its function becomes your focus: </i> <i> as the saying goes, when you hold a hammer, </i> <i> all the world looks like nails. </i> 

(Or should we say with Latour that when you hold a gun, everyone looks like potential victim… ;-)) 

Physicality shifts place, but we still have bodies: hands operating keyboards, trackpads; eyes that judge, limbs suffering from RSI. To often, craft is made synonymous with ‘handmade’ and software ubiqutous – in short: craft is not solely manual, and software is not body-less 

Maybe those two truisms could help rethink craft beyond the patriarchal master-apprentice system that is still en vogue with typographers. The problem with type-design is, that it is often thought of as signature; writing in purified form. But in a networked world this cannot be the only way to do type. Typographers, while using digital tools for longer than most of us, have a hard time to let go of a closed model of authorship, and a hierarchical approach to teaching. I am not sure why it the stereotypical image of the lonely, ascetic, male typographer fighting against all odds for the survival of an undervalued secret craft seems so necessary to be maintained.
